This Library provides a shared toolbox for Oasys Grasshopper plugins, enabling the handling of engineering units, custom component UIs, and helper methods for input/output. It includes features like shared default units, GH_UnitNumber parameters for passing unit-based objects between components, and abstract classes to facilitate custom UI and parameter management. Suitable for developers creating Grasshopper plugins, this library simplifies handling units and component attributes while ensuring smooth interoperability between plugins.
